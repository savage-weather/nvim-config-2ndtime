# Idea(s)

- We jump to a [closed] fold
- We {unfold} it
- If its length is viewable, {fold} it,
  then move on to the next [closed fold]
  -> If not, move down 10 lines.
  ==> Only 2 mappings for up / down
  ====> Most of what we want already exist!
  --> Keybindings to remember:
  - Basic: zf, zo, zc, zd
  - Advanced: zr, zm, zR, zM, zj, zk
